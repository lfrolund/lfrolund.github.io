## Hot to get your website running
- Clone/fork my code
- Put it into a Github pages repository, which MUST have the name yourusername.github.io
- On Settings > Pages, set Source to /docs
- Install Hugo on your PC
- You can see a local copy of your website by setting the working directory to your Github repo, and then typing hugo server
- You can build the website by simply typing Hugo while your working directory is your repo
- This will create a folder "public", which Github uses to build your website
- Rename the "public" folder to "docs", and push all changes. Your website should be up and running after a minute or so!
