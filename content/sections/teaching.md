 A few examples of the visualizations I use to teach undergraduate applied econometrics:

  {{< figure link="/images/measurement_error.gif" caption="Measurement error" alt="This animation shows the consequences of measurement error in the independent variable in an OLS regression. As the random measurement error increases, the estimated slope becomes flatter - this is called attenuation bias." >}}
   {{< figure link="/images/3DPlot_OVB.png"  caption="Omitted variable bias visualized" alt="The figure visualizes how omitted variable bias works in a simple wage-education-ability framework. Just looking at the correlation between education and wages, we could conclude that higher education leads to higher wages. However, in this case, the association purely comes from the fact that higher ability is correlated with both more education and higher wages. Seen in three dimensions makes this clear.">}}
  {{< figure link="/images/clt.gif" caption="Central Limit Theorem in Action" alt="This images shows the Central Limit Theorem in action. We throw a number of dice and record the mean opf all these dice 100,000 times. As we increase the number of dice thrown in a single time from 1 to 50, the distribution of the overall means becomes more and more similar to a normal distribution.">}}
