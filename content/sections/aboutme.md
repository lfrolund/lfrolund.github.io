Welcome to my website! I am a second year Ph.D. student in economics at the University of California, Berkeley. I am interested in political economy and development economics, and have previously worked on conflict and political reservations in India, democratic transitions and state repression, and longevity.

Before my Ph.D., I worked as a predoc with  <a href="https://robinburgess.com" target="_blank">Robin Burgess</a> and <a href="https://orianabandiera.net" target="_blank">Oriana Bandiera</a> at the LSE, where I also did a masters in economics.
