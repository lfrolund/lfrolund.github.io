    This paper analyzes the effect of political reservations on low-level subnational conflict in India. The recent literature on the impact of reservations on public goods provison finds that reservations benefit the targeted minorities. This may come at the detriment of other minorities or forward castes. I explore the latter possibility in a simple formal model of targeted public goods provision. The model indicates that reservations reduce conflict the larger and economically more disadvantaged the targeted minority is. However, this result may be mediated by reelection incentives. I investigate the predictions of the model with empirical data from Indian constituencies and village-level surveys. At the constituency level, where politicians can be reelected, reservations are associated with significantly lower levels of conflict. At the village level, the rotation of reservations constitutes an implicit term limit, and reservation is, if at all, associated with more conflict.

   Although there is consensus that full democracies are less repressive than other regime types, the establishment of full democracy is not always followed by reduced state repression. Against that background, this paper examines heterogeneity in the relationship between democracy and government violations of human rights. Drawing on arguments from the civil war literature, we develop a simple model that highlights opposing effects of democracy on state repression. Consequently, the net effect of democracy is shown to be ambiguous. Furthermore, the model reveals that pacifying (adverse) effects of democracy are more likely to dominate in countries with higher (lower) income levels. These implications are tested empirically using different methodological approaches, including time-series cross-sectional regressions, event studies, and a recent generalization of the synthetic control method. Our analyses confirm that democracy is related to reduced repression in relatively rich countries, whereas we find no or even adverse effects in poor countries.
